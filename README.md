# LibgdxTTFTextField
Use TTF font for TextField of Libgdx, especially usefully for Asian characters(Chinenes, Japanese, Korean).
Currently work well in Android with a little latency, which can be ignored when users input characters.
In desktop, it currently doesn't work.
In robovm, it's not been tested yet.
Just for demonstration now.
